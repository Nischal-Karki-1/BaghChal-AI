# ðŸš€ BaghChal AI
## What is the project about?
This project is an interactive implementation of BaghChal, a traditional Nepali board game, where players can compete against an AI opponent or play in multiplayer mode. The AI is powered by the Min-Max algorithm. The game was developed using C++ and the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML), and Audacity was used to enhance the sound effects for a more immersive experience.



## Features

- **Single-player mode:** Play against an AI opponent, which uses the Min-Max algorithm to strategize and make decisions.
- **Multiplayer mode:** Players can compete against each other, with one controlling the tigers and the other controlling the goats.
- **Interactive UI:** The game interface is visually interactive and built using SFML.
- **Game Mechanics:** Players control either the tigers or goats, with AI or the second player handling the opposing side.
- **Strategic AI:** The AI uses the Min-Max algorithm to evaluate moves and compete at a challenging level.
- **Sound Effects:** The sound effects were enhanced using Audacity, making the game experience more immersive.
- **Traditional Rules:** The game adheres to the classic rules of BaghChal, offering an authentic experience.

 #### **Working**
- Prepare the complete Game Tree.
- Evaluate the score of each branch, using the evaluation function.
- Back-up score from the nodes to the root by:
    - Selecting the child node with a maximum score for Max player.
    - Selecting the child node with the minimum score for Min player.
- It is based on these values/scores that the quality (good or bad) of the move is decided.
-  At the root node, the node with the max value is selected and the corresponding move is performed.
